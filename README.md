Some fun coding projects I've done to play games in the terminal.

## Contents:
1. Tic-Tac-Toe.py
2. rock_paper_scissors.py

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic game and my first attempt at making something "fun". This game is easily broken, can't determine when someone wins, and has no computer to play against.

Sounds like an easy win to me.

### 2. rock_paper_scissors
This game incorperates while loops to dodge fatal errors, keeps score and has a computer to play against.

I've also included rock_paper_scissors_cheat.py with a computer opponent who will never lose.
